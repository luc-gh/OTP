# OTP
A simple representative page of an OTP verification system, developed with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with responsiveness.

The implementation was done considering that the generated password is unique for each reload. No time limit. The more common logic, with passwords that have a time and/or execution limit, was not considered, since the goal is only to demonstrate the basic functionality and a type of design.

Check out the execution with [Vercel](https://otp-luc.vercel.app/).
